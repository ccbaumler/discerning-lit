	abstract = {This paper presents the development of an object rotator to be applied in digital radiography to modify it as 3D micro-CT. The device was developed using I2C LCD display, tactile buttons and a stepper motor with an L293D motor shield. The first development stage was testing all components. The circuit was designed and then realized using the components that were tested. The device was designed to rotate discretely from rotation angle of 0 - 360 in 256 steps. For performance testing, the device was tested for a rotation angle range of 0 to 90. The images of each rotation were captured and measured by Inkscape to determine the magnitude of the rotate angle of the object rotating device. The measurement results are compared with theoretical data to determine device error. The highest error was 4.79%. The device was then applied in digital radiography as an object rotator so that the digital radiography functioned as a micro-CT. By using a phantom as an object, the device as an object rotator in micro-CT was tested. The results showed that the device could capture and develop a 3D image of the phantom. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Convergent extension of the chordamesoderm is the best-examined gastrulation movement in Xenopus. Here we study general features of cell-cell contacts in this tissue by combining depletion of adhesion factors C-cadherin, Syndecan-4, fibronectin, and hyaluronic acid, the analysis of respective contact width spectra and contact angles, and La3+ staining of the pericellular matrix. We provide evidence that like in other gastrula tissues, cell-cell adhesion in the chordamesoderm is largely mediated by different types of pericellular matrix. Specific glycocalyx structures previously identified in Xenopus gastrula tissues are absent in chordamesoderm but other contact types like 10–20 nm wide La3+ stained structures are present instead. Knockdown of any of the adhesion factors reduces the abundance of cell contacts but not the average relative adhesiveness of the remaining ones: a decrease of adhesiveness at low contact widths is compensated by an increase of contact widths and an increase of adhesiveness proportional to width. From the adhesiveness-width relationship, we derive a model of chordamesoderm cell adhesion that involves the interdigitation of distinct pericellular matrix units. Quantitative description of pericellular matrix deployment suggests that reduced contact abundance upon adhesion factor depletion is correlated with excessive accumulation of matrix material in non-adhesive gaps and the loss of some contact types. © 2024 Luu et al.

	abstract = {The optical character recognition for the right to left and cursive languages such as Arabic is challenging and received little attention from researchers in the past compared to the other Latin languages. Moreover, the absence of a standard publicly available dataset for several low-resource languages, including the Pashto language remained a hurdle in the advancement of language processing. Realizing that, a clean dataset is the fundamental and core requirement of character recognition, this research begins with dataset generation and aims at a system capable of complete language understanding. Keeping in view the complete and full autonomous recognition of the cursive Pashto script. The first achievement of this research is a clean and standard dataset for the isolated characters of the Pashto script. In this paper, a database of isolated Pashto characters for forty four alphabets using various font styles has been introduced. In order to overcome the font style shortage, the graphical software Inkscape has been used to generate sufficient image data samples for each character. The dataset has been pre-processed and reduced in dimensions to 32×32 pixels, and further converted into the binary format with a black background and white text so that it resembles the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database. The benchmark database is publicly available for further research on the standard GitHub and Kaggle database servers both in pixel and Comma Separated Values (CSV) formats. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Visual materials consisting of images and graphics were realized using the Inkscape program. Practical applications made with Geogebra allows for practical determination of the earthquake parameters. Scientific investigation of earthquakes can be used both in face-to-face classes and online ones while addressing high-school students during Physics classes. It can be successfully employed as an application of mechanical waves or as a standalone subject for optional courses.

	abstract = {Introduction: A former study on orthopantomograms from young children with abnormal dental development (not canine ectopia) demonstrated that the tooth bud of the mandibular canine, compared to a stable longitudinal canine axis, could be located normally, anteriorly or posteriorly, with close relation to the first premolar. Aim: The aim of the present study is to analyse on orthopantomograms if the canine axis can demonstrate where the ectopic mandibular canine started tooth formation. Materials: The material consists of orthopantomograms with ectopic mandibular canines and presence of primary mandibular canines from 47 cases (29 cases 9–21 years old and 18 cases with unknown ages). The primary canines demonstrated from minor apical resorption to more severe apical resorption. Methods: Based on canine maturity, location of the canine axes and the interrelationships between the roots of the permanent canine and first premolar, the location from where the canine started tooth formation was determined. Canine maturity. Maturity stage below half root length and maturity stage above half root length revealed that 11 ectopic canines had less than half root length and 36 cases more than half root length. Canine axes. The canine axis, through the length of the primary canines Ax, is inserted on drawings of the orthopantomograms using the tracing programme Inkscape®. Interrelationship between roots. By visual inspection, the distance between the canine and first premolar was designated close distance, normal distance and extended distance. Results: The results are divided into 3 groups. Group 1: The initial site of the permanent ectopic canine is located within the canine axis (6 cases). Group 2: The initial site of the permanent ectopic canine is located posterior to the canine axis (36 cases). Group 3: The initial site of the permanent ectopic canine is located anterior to the canine axis (5 cases). Conclusion: The study explained that the canine axis could divide cases of ectopic canines into three groups according to the location from where tooth formation starts. For getting closer to the pattern of the ectopic canine eruption, it is necessary to analyse series of orthopantomograms taken from the same individual over several years. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The antitumor potential of proteins from snake venoms has been studied in recent decades, and evidence has emerged that phospholipases A2 can selectively attack cells of various types of tumors. Previous results have shown that phospholipase A2 “Pllans-II,” isolated from Porthidium lansbergii lansbergii snake venom, displayed antitumoral activity on cervical cancer and did not alter the viability of non-tumorigenic cells. However, until now, there was no evidence of its safety at the local and systemic levels, nor had experiments been developed to demonstrate that its production using recombinant technology allows us to obtain a molecule with effects similar to those generated by native phospholipase. Thus, we evaluated the impact caused by Pllans-II on murine biomodels, determining whether it induced local hemorrhage or increased pro-inflammatory and liver damage markers and histological alterations in the liver and kidneys. Additionally, the protein was produced using recombinant technology using a pET28a expression vector and the BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli strain. Equally, its enzymatic activity and anticancer effect were evaluated on cervical cancer lines such as HeLa and Ca Ski. The results demonstrated that Pllans-II did not generate hemorrhagic activity, nor did it increase the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1B, or TNF-α at doses of 3.28, 1.64, and 0.82 mg/kg. There was also no evidence of organ damage, and only ALT and AST increased in mild levels at the two highest concentrations. Additionally, the recombinant version of Pllans-II showed conservation in its catalytic activity and the ability to generate death in HeLa and Ca Ski cells (42% and 23%, respectively). These results demonstrate the innocuity of Pllans-II at the lowest dose and constitute an advance in considering a molecule produced using recombinant technology a drug candidate for selective attacks against cervical cancer. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Modeling and simulation of fluid flow are considered essential for engineers and scientists to better understand, develop, optimize, and control a process. In the fields of the microfluidics and porous media, researchers are constantly trying to develop innovative geometry microchannel to achieve optimum effectiveness. The difficulty in fabricating microchannel also leads to increases in manufacturing costs. Therefore, it becomes difficult or even impossible to use such structures in tests. However, programs for numerical simulation show their advantages in terms of functionality, pricing, and usability. This investigation was focused on a numerical analysis of fluid flows using cider vinegar residues as the porous medium and employing COMSOL Multiphysics Software. The porous medium was modeled from scanning electron microscopy images of the residues, which showed that the surface was irregular and porous. These images were converted to a binary file using ImageJ software and then saved as DXF file utilizing Inkscape software to make them geometry readable in COMSOL. The fluid flow was simulated for different cases. The inflow of a Newtonian fluid into a porous medium was mathematically described by the Navier–Stokes equation and the continuity equation.

	abstract = {Lagoons play an important socio-economic role and represent a precious natural heritage at risk from fishing pressure and chemical and biological pollution. Our research focused on better understanding the discrimination of fish biodiversity, the detection of non-indigenous species, and the valorization of commercial indigenous species at Mellah lagoon (Algeria). Taxonomic characterization and barcoding for all fish species and Inkscape schematic drawings for the most common species are provided. A total of 20 families and 37 species were recorded. The thermophilic species Coris julis, Thalassoma pavo, and Aphanius fasciatus and tropical species such as Gambusia holbrooki and Parablennius pilicornis were identified. Numerous Mediterranean species of socio-economic importance are highlighted, and detailed information is summarized for the lagoon’s sustainability. This short-term evaluation goes hand in hand with long-term programs documenting the interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous species in the lagoon and will allow the development of a provisional relationship model for future studies. Thermophilic and tropical species patterns in the Mellah lagoon are presented. Taken together, we provide useful data that can guide future investigations and may become a potential management tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and protecting species with large socio-economic roles from potential thermal stress impact. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Unhealthy eating habits of children have a significant impact on the development of different chronic non-communicable diseases, therefore it is important to encourage children to develop healthy eating habits within the frame of formal as well as informal education. Nutrition education included in Slovenian elementary school syllabus may contribute significantly to the pupils' development of nutrition literacy. Proper methods and forms of work have to be selected in order to achieve goals connected to basic nutrition knowledge and skills, and to a healthy lifestyle. Today, modern ICT technologies enable teachers to introduce children to learning contents using educational computer games. The inclusion of educational computer games motivates problem solving by children, improves the efficiency of the educational process and potentially influences the formation of healthy nutrition habits in pupils. With the aim to improve children's nutrition literacy, we developed an educational computer game for the nutrition contents that are included in mandatory and elective subjects of the nine-year elementary school. The game's objective is to encourage children to evaluate their lifestyles and to form healthy nutrition and movement habits, as well as to look for balance between work and relaxation. Through the game, pupils plan activities referring to the organisation and realisation of common daily activities such as eating, moving, learning and spending their free time. Once the activities are done, pupils obtain a mark and information how the planned activities were compatible with healthy lifestyle recommendations. Based on the report, they can continue to plan new activities aimed at improving their lifestyle. The educational computer game was elaborated on the Unity3d software platform and represents technically complex work which involves developing the concept of the contents of the game and computer programming. SketchUp programme was used to design the scenery and 3D objects, and Phooshop and Inkscape were used for two-dimensional objects. The game code was written in C# programme language. The game can be included at various didactic stages of the educational process. We estimate that using the game in the educational process will help increase pupils' motivation to learn nutrition contents and to form positive attitudes, intentions and behaviours connected to a healthy lifestyle.},

	abstract = {This paper characterizes non-indigenous fish species (NIS) and analyses both atmospheric and sea surface temperatures for the Mediterranean coast of Egypt from 1991 to 2020, in relation to previous reports in the same areas. Taxonomical characterization depicts 47 NIS from the Suez Canal (Lessepsian/alien) and 5 from the Atlantic provenance. GenBank accession number of the NIS mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase 1, reproductive and commercial biodata, and a schematic Inkscape drawing for the most harmful Lessepsian species were reported. For sea surface temperatures (SST), an increase of 1.2◦ C to 1.6◦ C was observed using GIS software. The lack of linear correlation between annual air temperature and annual SST at the same detection points (Pearson r) could suggest a difference in submarine currents, whereas the Pettitt homogeneity test highlights a temperature breakpoint in 2005–2006 that may have favoured the settlement of non-indigenous fauna in the coastal sites of Damiette, El Arish, El Hammam, Alexandria, El Alamain, and Mersa Matruh, while there seems to be a breakpoint present in 2001 for El Sallum. This assessment of climate trends is in good agreement with the previous sightings of non-native fish species.

	abstract = {Aim: In order to improve the surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Streptococcal Infections implemented whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This article reports the first WGS data on S. pneumoniae isolates in the Czech Republic. material and methods: Thirty-five isolates of S. pneumoniae from IPD recovered in 2017-2019 were selected for WGS. These were serotypes 4, 8, 9V, 19A, and 22F, which were determined by the Quellung reaction in combination with endpoint multiplex PCR (mPCR). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is routinely used for more detailed analysis termed sequence typing. The selected isolates were analysed by WGS on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The sequences obtained were processed using the Velvet de novo Assembler software. The assembled genomes were uploaded into the PubMLST database, using the BIGSdb platform, and then scanned automatically and molecularly characterized. The isolates were compared at three resolution levels: seven MLST genes, 53 ribosomal genes (rMLST), and 1420 genes (all loci). The all loci scheme covers MLST genes, ribosomal genes, and core genome MLST genes (cgMLST). These are all currently defined genes of S. pneumoniae available in the PubMLST database. Distance matrices based on the number and variability of all loci analysed were generated automatically using the Genome Comparator tool. Phylogenetic networks were created and edited with the SplitsTree4 package, using the NeighborNet algorithm. The final graphics were edited with the Inkscape software. results: Based on an overall view of the phylogenetic networks, it can be concluded that the genetic lines within each of S. pneumoniae serotypes 4, 8, 9V, 19A, and 22F are highly unrelated, to the same extent as if the isolates were of different serotypes. S. pneumoniae isolates of the same serotype, whether or not of the same sequence type, can be described, based on the results, as a non-homogeneous group with a number of unrelated genetic clusters that share genes assigning them to a specific serotype. WGS has also shown its discriminatory power, allowing the assignment of isolates of the same serotype and sequence type to different genetic clusters. conclusion: Of the methods used so far in the Czech Republic, WGS allows the most detailed characterization of S. pneumoniae isolates. It is highly desirable to integrate it in the molecular surveillance of IPD in the Czech Republic, similarly to other countries in Europe and in the world. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E.

	abstract = {Widespread pain is considered a sign of central sensitization in people with chronic pain. Our aim was to examine whether pain extent, assessed from the pain drawing, relates to measures from quantitative sensory testing in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Thirty women with FMS and no other co-morbid conditions completed pain drawings (dorsal and ventral views) and clinical and related disability questionnaires. Pain extent and pain frequency maps were obtained from the pain drawings using a novel customized software. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed over the 18 tender points considered by the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FMS diagnosis and over two additional standardized points. Heat and cold pain thresholds were also assessed on the dorsal aspect of the neck, the dorsal aspect of the wrist, and the tibialis anterior. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between pain extent and quantitative sensory testing outcomes as well as clinical symptoms. Larger extent of pain was associated with a higher pain intensity (dorsal area: rs = 0.461, P = 0.010; total area: rs = 0.593, P = 0.001), younger age (ventral area: rs = −0.544, P = 0.002; total area: rs = −0.409, P = 0.025), shorter history of pain (ventral area: rs = −0.367, P = 0.046), and higher cold pain thresholds over the tibialis anterior muscle (rs = −0.406, P = 0.001). No significant association was observed between pain extent and the remaining outcomes. Pain drawings constitute an easy and accurate approach to quantify widespread pain.

	abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to harness the value of radiomics models combining intratumoral and peritumoral features obtained from pretreatment CT to predict treatment response as well as the survival of LA-NPC(locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma) patients receiving multiple types of induction chemotherapies, including immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Methods: 276 LA-NPC patients (221 in the training and 55 in the testing cohort) were retrospectively enrolled. Various statistical analyses and feature selection techniques were applied to identify the most relevant radiomics features. Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared to build signatures for the intratumoral and each peritumoral region, along with a clinical signature. The performance of each model was evaluated using different metrics. Subsequently, a nomogram model was constructed by combining the best-performing radiomics and clinical models. Results: In the testing cohort, the nomogram model exhibited an AUC of 0.816, outperforming the other models. The nomogram model’s calibration curve showed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes in both the training and testing sets. When predicting survival, the model’s concordance index (C-index) was 0.888 in the training cohort and 0.899 in the testing cohort, indicating its robust predictive ability. Conclusion: In conclusion, the combined nomogram model, incorporating radiomics and clinical features, outperformed other models in predicting treatment response and survival outcomes for LA-NPC patients receiving induction chemotherapies. These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of the model, suggesting its value in individualized treatment planning and decision-making. © 2024, The Author(s).},

A skilled user is required to combine these traditional tools creatively to perform a useful task. This article presents an example of an approach that takes into account the semantics of the image and is therefore more powerful than traditional tools. Using a model of the foreground and the background of a given image, the SIOX tool (Simple Interactive Object Extraction) allows a user to cut out a certain object from an image or video with very little user interaction. The core of the algorithm is a color clustering approach that has been derived from image retrieval techniques and evaluated against a benchmark proposed by Microsoft Research. The method allows for sub-pixel accuracy, allows video segmentation in realtime (640 × 480 × 25), and is noise robust. SIOX has recently been integrated into the development versions of several open source image and video editing applications such as GIMP, Blender, and Inkscape. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This machine is built upon open-source software and low-cost hardware components. The machine incorporates three motors to control the X, Y, and Z axes, each with its respective function: the Y-stepper motor facilitates left and right motion, the X-stepper motor controls front and back motion, and the Z-Servo motor manages the up and down motion, all according to specified dimensions. These axes are controlled by the Arduino Uno microcontroller board, while these motors operate within a limited work area, with dimensions of 40 mm for the X-axis and 40 mm for the Y-axis. To utilize the machine effectively, users need to convert any image or text file into G-code using Inkscape software and then transmit it to the machine using G-code sender software.

	abstract = {The determination of the efficiency of adhesives applied in glued joints, through the analysis of the percentage of wood failure, is one of the main validation parameters for the quality of gluing techniques and adhesive. However, the subjectivity of the interpretation, performance, and visual acuity of the evaluators makes the methodology subjective. This research aimed to establish a method for evaluating the behavior of the glue line in glued joints, using freely available software and digital camera images. Shear samples of glued joints with polyvinyl acetate - PVAc, resorcinol formaldehyde - RF, and melamine formaldehyde - MF were evaluated using digital images obtained by a 16.1-megapixel camera. The images were pre-processed to enable vectorization in Inkscape software, version 1.1.2. Each image was vectorized and subjected to the measurement of the areas of the generated vector layers (glue line and wood). The validation process was performed by evaluating the accuracy of vectorization. Thus, the photograph of each sample and the vectorized image were imported into ImageJ software, version 1.53. To ensure the reliability of the proposed methodology, statistical analyses of the Kappa coefficient, global accuracy, user, and producer were applied. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method in relation to the conventional method provided in ASTM D5266-13, five evaluators analyzed the proportion of bond line and wood failure of the 10 samples submitted to the proposed methodology. Subsequently, a descriptive analysis of the data was carried out to evaluate the variability and subjectivity of the conventional analyses among the evaluators. It is noted that the proposed methodology achieved high efficiency in the analysis of the proportion of glue line and wood, and it can be assured by the accuracy tests performed. The research also showed that there was no agreement among the five evaluators using the conventional method. It is concluded that the proposed methodology meets the research objective, with high levels of accuracy, and confirms the subjectivity of the analyses performed with the conventional methodology. The results underscore the need for objective methodologies, employing computational techniques to reduce subjectivity in adhesive bond failure assessments, enhancing critical decisions in the selection of adhesives for industrial structural applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small scale garment makers (Tailors) face tremendous problems in meeting deadlines for customer delivery due to the inability to complete large orders in time. The art of garment making involves three steps before the final stitching, namely, measurement taking, tracing of the pattern and cutting of the traced pattern. It is often observed that the process of pattern tracing and cutting is time-consuming. Given an alternative, if this process could be automated, the garment maker can easily utilize this time in stitching and getting the garment ready, thereby increasing throughput. Hence, the proposed system aims at designing and building a gadget that will reduce the time taken for this process.The user will have to provide certain inputs with regard to measurements and patterns using the GUI, as will be discussed subsequently. The pattern to be cut is usually a pre-defined outline that is usually traced when done manually. In this system, the pattern is fed prior to the pattern cutting process in the database. The image generated is then converted into a G-code file. This is done using Inkscape programming. This will then be fed to the machine with the assistance of a Universal G-code Sender (UGS). The overall system consists of a programmable circuit board (Arduino) which is the brain of this system that controls the stepper motors that help move the laser along with the workspace.The Arduino processes the set of machine language instructions and triggers the stepper motor drivers, which in turn control the stepper motors. The machine will cut the precise input pattern on the fabric using a laser. The software used is open source. © 2021 IEEE.},

The input of the proposed system is an existing TrueType font and the output is an neural style transferred OpenType-SVG color font. Each character glyph contains a series of vector graphics path elements. A neural style transferred glyph consists of dozens of random Bézier curves initially distributed among the glyph space, gradually converging to glyph stokes of a given character. In contract, the process of designing a font manually requires specialized skills for designers. They use mouse cursor to adjust strokes and glyph kerning for each character. It require hours to achieve a specific style. A Chinese font contains thousands of characters. Neural style transfer techniques can be used to speed up the process for designing decorative fonts. In addition, we add different colors to the curves in a an neural style transfer character for visual appealing. In order to support colors in a font, we choose OpenType-SVG format, allowing displaying colors in software like Illustrator or Inkscape.

	abstract = {Epigenetic clocks are valuable tools for estimating both chronological and biological age by assessing DNA methylation levels at specific CpG dinucleotides. While conventional epigenetic clocks rely on genome-wide methylation data, targeted approaches offer a more efficient alternative. In this study, we explored the feasibility of constructing a minimized epigenetic clock utilizing data acquired through the iPlex MassARRAY technology. The study enrolled a cohort of relatively healthy individuals, and their methylation levels of eight specific CpG dinucleotides in genes SLC12A5, LDB2, FIGN, ACSS3, FHL2, and EPHX3 were evaluated using the iPlex MassARRAY system and the Illumina EPIC array. The methylation level of five studied CpG sites demonstrated significant correlations with chronological age and an acceptable convergence of data obtained by the iPlex MassARRAY and Illumina EPIC array. At the same time, the methylation level of three CpG sites showed a weak relationship with age and exhibited a low concordance between the data obtained from the two technologies. The construction of the epigenetic clock involved the utilization of different machine-learning models, including linear models, deep neural networks (DNN), and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT). The results obtained from these models were compared with each other and with the outcomes generated by other well-established epigenetic clocks. In our study, the TabNet architecture (deep tabular data learning architecture) exhibited the best performance (best MAE = 5.99). Although our minimized epigenetic clock yielded slightly higher age prediction errors compared to other epigenetic clocks, it still represents a viable alternative to the genome-wide epigenotyping array. © 2024 by the authors.},

On one hand, the SVG format is employed to store graphics, and the relationship between graphics and model-data on the basis of XML is developed. On the other hand, CIM-E is employed as a standard to produce database storage format, which is easy for users to import and export standard CIM-E files. The proposed implementation method has the advantages of graph-model-data-database integration and high maintenance efficiency.

	abstract = {Most species of the bone-devouring marine annelid, Osedax, display distinct sexual dimorphism with macroscopic sedentary females rooted in bones and free-living microscopic dwarf males. The paedomorphic male resembles the non-feeding metatrochophore larva in size, presence of eight pairs of chaetae, and a head ciliation potentially representing a residual prototroch. The male development may thus uniquely reiterate and validate the theoretical heterochrony process “progenesis”, which suggests that an accelerated sexual maturation and early arrest of somatic growth can lead to a miniaturized and paedomorphic adult. In this study, we describe the postembryonic larval and juvenile organogenesis of Osedax japonicus to test for a potential synchronous arrest of somatic growth during male development. Five postembryonic stages could be distinguished, resembling day one to five in the larval development at 10°C: (0D) first cleavage of fertilized eggs (embryos undergo unequal spiral cleavage), (1D) pre-trochophore, with apical organ, (2D) early trochophore, + prototroch, brain, circumesophageal connectives and subesophageal commissure, (3D) trochophore, + telotroch, four ventral nerves, (4D) early metatrochophore, + protonephridia, dorsal and terminal sensory organs, (5D) metatrochophore, + two ventral paratrochs, mid-ventral nerve, posterior trunk commissure, two dorsal nerves; competent for metamorphosis. The larval development largely mirrors that of other lecithotrophic annelid larvae but does not show continuous chaetogenesis or full gut development. Additionally, O. japonicus larvae exhibit an unpaired, mid-dorsal, sensory organ. Female individuals shed their larval traits during metamorphosis and continue organogenesis (including circulatory system) and extensive growth for 2–3 weeks before developing oocytes. In contrast, males develop sperm within a day of metamorphosis and display a synchronous metamorphic arrest in neural and muscular development, retaining a large portion of larval features post metamorphosis. Our findings hereby substantiate male miniaturization in Osedax to be the outcome of an early and synchronous offset of somatic development, fitting the theoretical process “progenesis”. This may be the first compelling morpho-developmental exemplification of a progenetic origin of a microscopic body plan. The presented morphological staging system will further serve as a framework for future examination of molecular patterns and pathways determining Osedax development.

The amino acid sequences of vanA, vanB, vanR and vanS were used as queries to search against bacterial genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database. Hits with >60% amino acid identity and >90% query coverage were aligned, and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed. The ligase gene phylogenies were highly similar for both queries, revealing two major clusters. One contained [[vanA:vanM][vanB:vanD]vanF] and related proteins, with proteins from different Bacillaceae, mostly from Paenibacillus spp., in basal positions to all, except vanB. Ligases from streptomycetes formed the other cluster. The relative positions of vanH and vanX differed from those of the associated ligases, but the basal position of the Paenibacillus spp. and the separation of proteins of Streptomyces origin were similar. The accessory genes vanW, vanY and vanZ were associated with vanB, vanA/vanM and vanA, respectively; the basal branches were always proteins from different Bacillaceae but never from streptomycetes. Multiple homologs of the regulatory genes vanR and vanS were found in the genomes; those associated with the different ligases were unique to the ligases. Similarly to the accessory genes, vanRS from Bacillales and Clostridia, but never from streptomycetes, was found in the basal positions. In conclusion, the core genes vanA/B/D/F/M, vanH and vanX originate most probably from glycopeptide-producing streptomycetes, with Paenibacillus spp. (or other Bacillaceae) mediating the transfer, while the accessory genes and the regulatory apparatus probably originate from these Bacillaceae. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: As damage to coronary arteries is a potential complication of epicardial RF catheter ablation (EPRFCA), the procedure must be associated with coronary angiography. Chronic Chagasic cardiomiopathy (CCC) is a disease where epicardial VT are common. Eletroanatomic mapping merged with computed totmography (CT) scan data is a useful tool for mapping the endocardium, and its accuracy in guiding ablation on the epicardium was not adequately evaluated so far. Objective: Compare electronatomic map merged with Heart CT to fluoroscopy for epicardial ablation of CCC. Describe the distribution of the scars on CCC. Methods and results: We performed epicardial and endocardial mapping and ablation using CARTO XP V8 on eight patients and merged the map with coronary arteries CT scan using at least three landmarks. To compare the 3D image obtained with CARTO MERGE and the 2D fluoroscopic image obtained during the ablation procedure, we used computer graphic software (Inkscape™) in order to prove that the images were equivalent and to compare the distance between the catheter tip on fluoroscopy to catheter tip on 3D EA map. EPRFCA was successfully performed in all patients and they did not present recurrence for at least 3-month follow-up. The mean difference between the tip of the catheter on fluoroscopy and on the 3D model was 6.03±2.09 mm. Scars were present in the epicardium and endocardium and most of patients presented with posterior wall scars and RV scar. Conclusion: The combination of electroanatomic map and CT coronary artery scan data is feasible and can be an important tool for EPRFCA in patients with CCC and VT. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

All parts of the system are integrated into one single chip to get the maximum benefit from the microcontroller.In the industrial world, humans are greatly helped by the machines that have been created. One very useful machine is a CNC machine. This project utilizes a microcontroller as an automatic control on a CNC machine which aims to help simplify the programming of input files or data needed to move a CNC machine. The ball screw is used to convert the rotational motion generated from the stepper motor into a translational motion to move the working axis of the CNC machine. Designs that have been drawn on a personal computer will be converted into a G-Code form and then converted into microcontroller programing language using Inkscape application. The microcontroller uses a Pronterface application to read the data that has been transferred by the personal computer. Then this data is used to drive the two stepper motors, and a pattern is formed on the plane according to the design.The result of this CNC machine is to use a pen as an assumption of the drill bit, the precision of the distance traveled according to the input, and the milling experiment in the form of a certain image or writing.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli is frequently associated with mastitis in cattle. “Pathogenic” and “commensal” isolates appear to be genetically similar. With a few exceptions, no notable genotypic differences have been found between commensal and mastitis-associated E. coli. In this study, 24 E. coli strains were isolated from dairy cows with clinical mastitis in three geographic regions of Australia (North Queensland, South Queensland, and Victoria), sequenced, then genomically surveyed. There was no observed relationship between sequence type (ST) and region (p = 0.51). The most common Multi Locus Sequence Type was ST10 (38%), then ST4429 (13%). Pangenomic analysis revealed a soft-core genome of 3,463 genes, including genes associated with antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis, motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and pili. A total of 36 different plasmids were identified and generally found to have local distributions (p = 0.02). Only 2 plasmids contained antibiotic resistance genes, a p1303_5-like plasmid encoding multidrug-resistance (trimethoprim, quaternary ammonium, beta-lactam, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and kanamycin) from two North Queensland isolates on the same farm, while three Victorian isolates from the same farm contained a pCFSAN004177P_01-like plasmid encoding tetracycline-resistance. This pattern is consistent with a local spread of antibiotic resistance through plasmids of bovine mastitis cases. Notably, co-occurrence of plasmids containing virulence factors/antibiotic resistance with putative mobilization was rare, though the multidrug resistant p1303_5-like plasmid was predicted to be conjugative and is of some concern. This survey has provided greater understanding of antibiotic resistance within E. coli-associated bovine mastitis which will allow greater prediction and improved decision making in disease management. © Copyright © 2020 Alawneh, Vezina, Ramay, Al-Harbi, James, Soust, Moore and Olchowy.},

	abstract = {Acinetobacter bereziniae has emerged as a significant human pathogen, acquiring multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including carbapenemases. This study focuses on characterizing the plasmids harboring the blaNDM-1 and tet(Y) genes in two carbapenem-resistant A. bereziniae isolates (UCO-553 and UCO-554) obtained in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted on UCO-553 and UCO-554. Both isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing to ascertain their sequence type (ST), core genome multilocus sequence-typing (cgMLST) profile, antibiotic resistance genes, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements. Conjugation experiments were performed for both isolates. Results: Both isolates exhibited broad resistance, including resistance to carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and aminoglycosides. Both isolates belong to sequence type STPAS1761, with a difference of 17 out of 2984 alleles. Each isolate carried a 47,274 bp plasmid with blaNDM-1 and aph(3′)-VI genes and two highly similar plasmids: a 35,184 bp plasmid with tet(Y), sul2, aph(6)-Id, and aph(3″)-Ib genes, and a 6078 bp plasmid containing the ant(2″)-Ia gene. Quinolone-resistance mutations were identified in the gyrA and parC genes of both isolates. Importantly, blaNDM-1 was located within a Tn125 transposon, and tet(Y) was embedded in a Tn5393 transposon. Conjugation experiments successfully transferred blaNDM-1 and tet(Y) into the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 strain, indicating the potential for horizontal gene transfer. Conclusions: This study highlights the critical role of plasmids in disseminating resistance genes in A. bereziniae and underscores the need for the continued genomic surveillance of this emerging pathogen. The findings emphasize the importance of monitoring A. bereziniae for its potential to cause difficult-to-treat infections and its capacity to spread resistance determinants against clinically significant antibiotics. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, it is worth taking a look at the circumstances of the installation process. Students at Budapest University of Technology and Economics experienced some serious difficulties while installing MatLab, a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment, which is continuously used during the B.Sc. and M.Sc. studies. This problem may cause some legal trouble because we all know the similarities between university students and electricity - they follow the path with the lower resistance. University governances should also definitely consider this when setting up their software license-system, as a sufficient number of students will choose illegal ways to get access to a software if it is easier than getting it through the university licence. We examined mechatronics engineer freshmen (Department for Mechanical Engineering) of the university installing student-licensed MatLab on their own laptops performing (second level) TAP. An open source software, Inkscape was used during the experiment as a reference. Our main aspects were: how time-consuming and how mentally stressful it is for students to acquire the software. To get exact and numeric values of the latter, NASA Task Load Index papers were used after each software got installed. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

	abstract = {Since the raise of the Internet era, many browser-based on-line games have been created. When these games were developed in respect to Web standards, these have been limited by the inherent stateless and text-base nature of the Internet. Hence, these games are turn by turn based, graphically limited and hardly compatible from one browser to another; these are the reasons why developers usually prefer to implement browser games using plug-ins. While standards are not ready for real-time browser games yet, it is already possible to provide better graphics for a better gaming experience. Today, SVG is well supported in all major Web browsers, and is a stable standard compared to HTML 5. This paper presents an attempt of creating a browser game based on SVG. Some SVG games can already be found on the Internet [R1] [R2] but these are just simple games and are not massively multi-players. During the process, the question of how to leverage SVG at different steps of the development was raised. Many different technologies were needed, but SVG remains the guiding principle throughout the article. The game itself is supposed to be a strategic/role playing game; turn by turn based where players can live adventures and build civilizations in a fantasy world. The work related to this article was done as a hobby and is the result of 2 years of development, mainly over nights and week-ends.},

	abstract = {Salah (Salat/Sholat/Shalat/Prayer) is the second of five pillars of Islam which is mandatory for Moslem. Salah is extremely important because it is the first deed that will be calculated in the afterlife. The gestures and postures need to follow the guidance practiced by Prophet Muhammad SAW. One way to learn about them is by using guidebooks. Learning them through books is difficult and boring for some people, especially children, because it only shows 2D images. Thus, this research developed a three-dimensional animation Salah guide application based on Augmented Reality. It implemented a marker-based Augmented Reality with a QR code to differentiate. Through this application, users could learn about Salah’s gestures and postures in three-dimensional animation, therefore, they could see the visualization of the gestures and postures. This application was built using the Unity game engine. The assets were built using Audicity, GIMP, Inkscape, and Blender. Black box testing shows that 92.307% of the functions of the application are running as they intended. Meanwhile, according to the User Acceptance Test, the application is considered very good with a 97.7% response percentage. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Open Medicine (http://www.openmedicine.ca) is an electronic open access, peer-reviewed general medical journal that started publication in April 2007. The editors of Open Medicine have been exploring the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in constructing an efficient and sustainable publishing model that can be adopted by other journals. The goal of using FOSS is to minimize scarce financial resources and maximize return to the community by way of software code and high quality articles. Using information collected through archived documents and interviews with key editorial and technical staff responsible for journal development, this paper reports on the incorporation of FOSS into the production workflow of Open Medicine. We discuss the different types of software used; how they interface; why they were chosen; and the successes and challenges associated with using FOSS rather than proprietary software. These include the flagship FOSS office and graphics packages (OpenOffice, The GIMP, Inkscape), the content management system Drupal to run our Open Medicine Blog, wiki software MediaWiki to communicate and archive our weekly editorial and operational meeting agenda, minutes and other documents that the team can collectively edit, Scribus for automated layout and VOIP software Skype and OpenWengo to communicate. All software can be run on any of the main operating systems, including the free and open source GNU/Linux Operating system. Journal management is provided by Open Journal Systems, developed by the Public Knowledge Project (http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs). OJS assists with every stage of the refereed publishing process, from submissions, assignment of peer reviewers, through to online publication and indexing. The Public Knowledge Project has also recently developed Lemon8-XML (http://pkp.sfu.ca/lemon8), which automates the conversion of text document formats to XML, enabling structured markup of content for automated searching and indexing. As XML is required for inclusion in PubMed Central, this integrated, semi-automated processing of manuscripts is a key ingredient for biomedical publishing, and Lemon8-XML has significant resource implications for the many journals where XML conversion is currently done manually or with proprietary software. Conversion to XML and the use of Scribus has allowed semi-automated production of HTML and PDF documents for online publication, representing another significant resource saving. Extensive use of free and open source software by Open Medicine serves as a unique case study for the feasibility of FOSS use for all journals in scholarly publishing. It also demonstrates how innovative use of this software adds to a more sustainable publishing model that is replicable worldwide.},

Tools for making presentation with controlled interactivity include: Microsoft PowerPoint; Java Programming; HTML5; CSS4; Asymptote, Animated Gif; MathML and Beamer built with LATEX. with TikZ/PGF for animations etc. The ease and richness in depicting sophisticated mathematical notations, symbols, scientific and engineering drawings with the latter make them the appropriate tool for creating scientific concept animations. This paper focuses on an approach for generating presentations. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and implementation of a new approach in capturing and embedding scientific concept animation in presentations. The basic idea is to translate sequence tagged diagrams in 2D and 3D produced with Inkscape into Beamer frames with sequence diagrams annotated with commands for animation. The output of Beamer frames is then compiled by LATEX to produce PDF files that can be used in a presentation. The applicability of this work is in the developing of contents for lessons in Elearning sites. The targeted domain for use is in developing science and engineering lecture presentations.

	abstract = {In the present day, the traditional modes of public transport are challenging to provide an economical and fast solution, so the need for a cheaper and quicker implementation of a new public transport system is recognized by more and more countries. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems are becoming the most popular public transport option with medium carrying capacity. This system not only reduces the investment cost in public transportation but also achieves the operation effect close to that of rail transit. It uses modern public transport technology to cooperate with the operation and management of intelligent transportation so that the traditional public transport system can basically reach the service level of rail transit. In this study, the mapping methods of BRT system Road (graphically correct bus maps and schematic bus maps) are introduced and analyzed to improve the satisfaction of the BRT system in practical application. In addition, the applicable conditions of the two road-mapping methods and the principles needing attention in the drawing are also analyzed. As for the BRT system structure, this paper introduces a new BRT system model ("BRT + flexible line" mode), which is used to improve the speed of the BRT system. Firstly, the information of the BRT system is extracted from Xiamen, Guangzhou and Mexico, and the route map and design mode of BRT systems are analyzed and drawn by using ArcMap and Inkscape software. The relationship between line mapping and BRT system is summarized. Finally, the conditions and shortcomings of the experimental results are discussed, and it is pointed out that local conditions should be considered to simplify the drawing of geographically correct bus maps in the BRT system. This study can be widely used in the initial construction of the BRT system and the construction mode of air-light rail, and also can be applied to the drawing of the BRT system route map. It is hoped that this study can provide a starting point and useful experience for researchers in this field. © 2022 SPIE},

Unfortunately, this is typically a one-way process: once a visualization is exported from the generative tool into a drawing tool, it is difficult to make further, data-driven changes. In this paper, we propose a bridge model to allow designers to bring their work back from the drawing tool to re-edit in the generative tool. Our key insight is to recast this iteration challenge as a merge problem - similar to when two people are editing a document and changes between them need to reconciled. We also present a specific instantiation of this model, a tool called Hanpuku, which bridges between D3 scripts and Illustrator. We show several examples of visualizations that are iteratively created using Hanpuku in order to illustrate the flexibility of the approach. We further describe several hypothetical tools that bridge between other visualization tools to emphasize the generality of the model. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Open Source has traditionally been seen as lacking in full support of the needs of artists and graphic professionals. The most cited problem is a lack of color management systems (CMS) in Open Source applications such as GIMP and Inkscape. However, the landscape has changed greatly over the past year with major advancements on several fronts. The reality for Open Source graphic applications and their users is now significantly improved. This talk will present an overview of color management in Open Source applications including GIMP, Scribus and Inkscape, and on various operating systems including Linux, OS X and MS Windows. Any user of graphic applications from professionals though hobbyists and beginners can benefit from color management and color managed applications. After covering basics and tools to support color management, the new features in Inkscape related to color management will be explored, including how different users might leverage them for different needs and how color management for SVG differs from usual color management.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the first report of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in China in 2007, the prevalence of CRKP and CRE has increased significantly. However, the molecular characteristics of IMP-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (IMPKp) are rarely reported. Methods: A total of 29 IMPKp isolates were collected from a Chinese tertiary hospital from 2011 to 2017. Clinical IMPKp were identified by VITEK®MS, and further analyzed by whole-genome DNA sequencing with HiSeq and PacBio RSII sequencer. Sequencing data were analyzed using CSI Phylogeny 1.4, Resfinder, PlasmidFinder and the MLST tool provided by the Centre for Genomic Epidemiology. The analysis results were visualized using iTOL editor v1_1. The open reading frames and pseudogenes were predicted using RAST 2.0 combined with BLASTP/BLASTN searches against the RefSeq database. The databases CARD, ResFinder, ISfinder, and INTEGRALL were performed for annotation of the resistance genes, mobile elements, and other features. The types of bla IMP in clinical isolates were determined by BIGSdb-Pasteur. Integrons were drawn by Snapgene, and the gene organization diagrams were drawn by Inkscape 0.48.1. Results: Four novel ST type, including ST5422, ST5423, ST5426 and ST5427 were identified. The IMP-4 and IMP-1 were the dominant IMP type. The majority of bla IMP-carrying plasmids belonged to IncN and IncHI5. Two novel bla IMP-carrying integrons (In2146 and In2147) were uncovered. A novel variant bla IMP-90 presented in novel integron In2147 has been identified. Conclusions: IMPKp showed low prevalence in China. Novel molecular characteristics of IMPKp have been identified. Continuous monitoring of IMPKp shall also be carried out in the future. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Vector sketch software (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape) and touch-interactive technologies have long aided artists in the creation of resolution-independent digital drawings that mimic the unconstrained nature of freehand sketches. However, artist intent behind stroke topology is often ambiguous, complicating traditional segmentation tasks such as coloring. For inspiration, we turn to the winding number, a classic geometric property of interest for binary segmentation in the presence of boundary data. Its direct application for multi-region segmentation poses two main challenges: (1) strokes may not be consistently oriented to best identify perceptually salient regions; (2) for interior strokes there is no “correct” orientation, as either choice better distinguishes one of two neighboring regions. Thus, we form a harmonic feature space from multiple winding number fields and perform segmentation via Voronoi/power diagrams in this domain. Our perspective allows both for automatic fill region detection and for a semi-automatic framework that naturally incorporates user hints and interactive sculpting of results, unlike competing automatic methods. Our method is agnostic to curve orientation and gracefully handles varying gap sizes in the sketch boundary, outperforming state-of-the-art colorization methods on these “gappy” inputs. Moreover, it inherits the ability of winding numbers to specify “fuzzy” boundaries, leading to simple strategies for color diffusion and single-parameter-driven growing and shrinking of regions. © 2024 Eurographics - The European Association for Computer Graphics and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

A car driver must not only be able to see but also to be seen. The issue of headlight illumination is vital, especially during the dark hours of the night. Therefore, the focus of this article is determining the range of visibility of dipped (low-beam) headlights under specific experimental conditions. We also designed a methodical guideline aimed at identifying the distance at which dipped headlights illuminate the road while a vehicle is in motion. Research conducted on various classes of road confirmed that the Hyundai i40 is best used on higher-class roads, while the Dacia Sandero is better used on lower-class roads due to the shape and spreading out of its light cone. Furthermore, the pros and cons of the distribution of light cones on several classes of road are presented. Sensor-related equipment was also used to investigate light beam afterglow. In particular, an LX-1108 light meter was applied to determine the obstacle illumination intensity, the properties of which enable recording of low lighting values, and a DJI Mavic AIR 2 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) was utilized to record the data related to the location of the examined vehicle, as well as light afterglow at night; relevant data evaluation was carried out using Inkscape software. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: With continuing identification of novel structured noncoding RNAs, there is an increasing need to create schematic diagrams showing the consensus features of these molecules. RNA structural diagrams are typically made either with general-purpose drawing programs like Adobe Illustrator, or with automated or interactive programs specific to RNA. Unfortunately, the use of applications like Illustrator is extremely time consuming, while existing RNA-specific programs produce figures that are useful, but usually not of the same aesthetic quality as those produced at great cost in Illustrator. Additionally, most existing RNA-specific applications are designed for drawing single RNA molecules, not consensus diagrams.Results: We created R2R, a computer program that facilitates the generation of aesthetic and readable drawings of RNA consensus diagrams in a fraction of the time required with general-purpose drawing programs. Since the inference of a consensus RNA structure typically requires a multiple-sequence alignment, the R2R user annotates the alignment with commands directing the layout and annotation of the RNA. R2R creates SVG or PDF output that can be imported into Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape or CorelDRAW. R2R can be used to create consensus sequence and secondary structure models for novel RNA structures or to revise models when new representatives for known RNA classes become available. Although R2R does not currently have a graphical user interface, it has proven useful in our efforts to create 100 schematic models of distinct noncoding RNA classes.Conclusions: R2R makes it possible to obtain high-quality drawings of the consensus sequence and structural models of many diverse RNA structures with a more practical amount of effort.

	abstract = {This textbook summarizes the course of engineering mechanics, designed for one or two semesters, at the undergraduate or graduate level for a range of academic majors. The book covers all the main components of the discipline including: Theoretical Mechanics, Theory of Mechanisms and Machines, Resistance of Materials, Machine Parts and Design Basic; and Interchangeability, Standardization, and Technical Measurements. It can also be used by students of other technical areas in to achieve competence in each of the listed disciplines. The concise presentation facilitates concentration on the most important elements of the concepts presented while also outlining the current state of mechanics, demonstrating engineering applications using various computer packages (MathCad, CosmosWorks, Inkscape, AutoCad), and updating data on engineering materials. Examples of both simple and complex engineering calculations are given at the end of each chapter along with self-assessment questions. © The Editor (s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},
